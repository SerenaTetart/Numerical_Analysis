## Introduction
*The aim of this repository is not to cover the full course but rather explaining quickly the use of some algorithms in order to solve mathematical problems in an IT environment.*

We will focus on the branch of applied mathematic studying the developpement of tools/methods to compute approximations for scientific calculus with a computer.

## Part I- Interpolation

Numerical analysis is opposed to formal calculus because computers obviously doesn't understand functions such as cosinus, they are made of binary values: 0 and 1, they are limited in memory, thus they cannot understand infinity which is why we need to transition from a continuous set to a discrete set.

In order to do so we need a new way to represent functions, converting functions to polynomials is the easiest way to do so.
From only a set of points we are able to approximate functions as polynomials, this operation is called interpolation.

We will study only a few implementations of theses interpolations such as Lagrange, Newton and Hermite.

### Lagrange:

We won't go in the full details but you have to know that in order to interpolate a function f the polynomial p associated to f is calculated by:
